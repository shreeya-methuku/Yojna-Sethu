## What is Yojna-Setu?

Yojna-Setu is a **voice-first AI assistant** that helps rural Indians discover government welfare schemes they qualify for — in their native language (Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, or English).

**The Problem**: ₹1+ lakh crore of government welfare goes unclaimed annually because people don't know what schemes exist, don't know they qualify, and face language/digital barriers.

**The Solution**: Just speak in your language → AI matches you to schemes → Get audio guidance in your language.
